# C-Programming

I found this book in a little library not far from me and took the time to learn it. This is my first book on C, eventually I plan on getting more into the embedded side to work on tinker projects. For now this will help me get a foundation (Thought it is an older book) in the knowledge of C.

This repository was built to help me document my work from the "C Programming Absolute Beginner's Guide Third Edition by Greg Perry and Dean Miller"

Each chapter will contain key notes and test code
